===pty_nol.txt file===

A file providing information about legislators for a particular state and session.  

Apart from the first line, each line contains values for:
* LOCALID - a three digit identifier for a legislator
* NAME - a canonical name or alias for a legislator
* PARTYID - a three-digit party code for the legislator
* DISTRICTID - often a three-digit identifier

When such a file meets certain constraints, it is said to be **normalized**.  The main constraints are as follows:
* there is exactly one **canonical name** per LOCALID

===canonical name===
A distinguished name for a legislator.  This name will be used when coalescing voting vectors.
