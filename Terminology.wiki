===Canonical Name===
A distinguished name for a legislator.  This name will be used when coalescing voting vectors.

Within the context of a pty_nol.txt file, the canonical name for a LOCALID exists if and only if there is a single NAME associated with that LOCALID, ignoring all entries in which both the PARTYID and DISTRICTID have been zeroed-out.  

===Coalescence===
The process of combining two or more voting vectors of a single legislator into a single voting vector. For example, the voting vector resulting from combining 191 and 969 is 161.

===nomrecord.txt file===
A file containing details about the voting history of legislators.

Each row contains the following fields:
* LOCALID - three digit legislator id, unique within the context of this state and session.
* NAME - a character string
* VOTINGVECTOR - a character string with each vote encoded as a decimal digit

A correctly formated nomrecord.txt file is said to be **normalized** if each LOCALID appears at most once.

===pty_nol.txt file===

A file providing information about legislators for a particular state and session.  

Apart from the first line, each line contains values for:
* LOCALID - a three-digit identifier for a legislator
* NAME - a canonical name or alias for a legislator
* PARTYID - a three-digit party code for the legislator
* DISTRICTID - a character string (often a three-digit identifier)

When such a file meets certain constraints, it is said to be **normalized**.  Apart from being properly formated, the main constraints are as follows:
* there is exactly one **canonical name** per LOCALID
* the PARTYID and DISTRICTID of all non-canonical names are both "000".
* neither the PARTYID nor the DISTRICTID of a canonical name are "000"

==Voting Vector==
A string of decimal digits reflecting the voting record of a single legislator:

* 0 - not a member
* 1 - yea
* 2 - paired yea
* 3 - announced yea
* 4 - announced nay
* 5 - paired nay
* 6 - nay
* 7 - unresolved (conflicting evidence)
* 9 - no vote recorded

Within a single nomrecord.txt file, the voting vectors should all be of the same length, and the results of a particular rollcall should all be represented at the same position.  

Usually, the voting vector is in chronological order, but that is currently not a requirement.
