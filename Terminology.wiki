===pty_nol.txt file===

A file providing information about legislators for a particular state and session.  

Apart from the first line, each line contains values for:
* LOCALID - a three-digit identifier for a legislator
* NAME - a canonical name or alias for a legislator
* PARTYID - a three-digit party code for the legislator
* DISTRICTID - a character string (often a three-digit identifier)

When such a file meets certain constraints, it is said to be **normalized**.  Apart from being properly formated, the main constraints are as follows:
* there is exactly one **canonical name** per LOCALID
* the PARTYID and DISTRICTID of all non-canonical names are both "000".
* neither the PARTYID nor the DISTRICTID of a canonical are "000"

===Canonical Name===
A distinguished name for a legislator.  This name will be used when coalescing voting vectors.

Within the context of a pty_nol.txt file, the canonical name for a LOCALID exists if and only if there is a single NAME associated with that LOCALID, ignoring all entries in which both the PARTYID and DISTRICTID have been zeroed-out.
