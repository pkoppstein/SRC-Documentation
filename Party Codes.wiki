==Three-digit Codes==

A table of three-digit codes for political parties is in the file data/party.tsv.  It contains the three-digit code and party name as shown in the table below, except that the party name for 700 is given as OTHER. 

On each line, the defined three-digit code is shown, together with the intended interpretation and any short forms that may be allowed in the Corrections.csv format (see [[Format_for_Editing_Directives]]).

(~*) "700" is a "catch-all" code for organizations that have not been assigned, and are not likely to be assigned, a three-digit code.

(~*~*) r&d and d&r in NH should be coded as for REPUBLICAN and DEMOCRAT respectively.

(~*~*~*) Includes Democratic-Farmer-Labor

[~*IP] Independence Party of NY, Independence Party of MN, and other parties historically affiliated with the Independence Party of America, founded in 2007 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Party_of_America].

If an additional code is needed, consult VoteView (http://voteview.com/party3.htm).

=== Vacancies ===
If a seat is vacant during a session, the UNKNOWN value (999) should be used for the party code. The entry would therefore look like this:
{{{
nnn (Vacant)                    999 districtid
}}}
where "nnn" is a valid LOCALID and "districtid" is the district id.
