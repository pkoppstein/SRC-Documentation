==Charset==
Files should be encoded using charset=iso-8859-1, also known as "latin1".

This is a standard 8-bit code for Western languages and includes ASCII as well as accented characters (é etc).

The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252|Windows-1252]] codepage coincides with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1|ISO/IEC_8859-1]] for all codes except in the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F). See this [[http://www.i18nqa.com/debug/table-iso8859-1-vs-windows-1252.html|comparison chart]] for details.

==Apostrophes and Quotation Marks==
ISO 8859-1 does not have “curved double quotes” or ‘curved single quotes’.  Accordingly, ordinary double quotes (") or apostrophes (') should be used instead, especially in the NAME field of pty_nol.txt and nomrecord.txt files.  Please do not use the accent character (´) as an apostrophe, and avoid back-ticks (`) in names.  For example, //Eugene “Gene” O’Neill// could be rendered as **O'Neill, Eugene "Gene"**.
 
==Checking and Conversion==
On Linux or Mac, use the **file** command to check the encoding of one or more files. The **iconv** command can be used to perform conversions, e.g.:
{{{
# to convert from utf-8 to ISO-8859-1:
iconv -c -f utf8 -t ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT
}}}

{{{
# to convert from WINDOWS-1252 to ISO-8859-1:
iconv -c -f windows-1252 -t ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT
}}}

===Linux===
{{{
$ file -i pty_nol.txt
pty_nol.txt: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
}}}

"us-ascii" is a subset of latin1 and is therefore acceptable. 
===Mac===
{{{
$ file -I pty_nol.txt
pty_nol.txt: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
}}}
