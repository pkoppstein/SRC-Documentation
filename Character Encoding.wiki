Files should be encoded using charset=iso-8859-1, also known as "latin1".

This is a standard 8-bit code for Western languages and includes ASCII.  The Windows-1252 codepage coincides with ISO-8859-1 for all codes except in the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F).

To avoid difficulties, do not use "smart quotes" in the NAME field of pty_nol.txt and nomrecord.txt files.  Accented characters (Ã© etc) can be used.

For further details, see for example [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1|ISO/IEC_8859-1]].

==Checking and Conversion==
On Linux or Mac, use the file command to check the encoding of one or more files. The "iconv" command can be used to perform conversions.
===Linux===
{{{
$ file -i pty_nol.txt
pty_nol.txt: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
}}}
===Mac===
{{{
$ file -I pty_nol.txt
pty_nol.txt: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
}}}
