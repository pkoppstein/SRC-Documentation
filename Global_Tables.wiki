==members.tsv==

members.tsv is a global table for individuals.  The only required fields are GLOBALID and SURNAME.

The mapping from GLOBALID to other ids is achieved via the so-called "Rosetta Stone" table, rosetta.tsv.

* GLOBALID - the SRC global id for this person; normally, this is of the form STccyyClid where:
** ST is a two-letter state code
** ccyy is a four-digit year
** C is either U or L (for upper or lower chamber)
** lid is the three-digit SRC localid for this person in ST/st_yy/reg
* SURNAME - normally as listed in the vote record
+ FIRSTNAME - first name or at least first initial; at least one of BIRTHYEAR or full FIRSTNAME should be given
MIDDLENAMES - preferably all middle names, or at least initials
ALTERNATIVESURNAMES - multiple alternatives should be separated by | (e.g. "Smith|Jones")
SUFFIX - the suffix or suffixes, for example: Jr. III
NICKNAME - usually a single name, without parentheses or quotation marks, for example: Jim
+ BIRTHYEAR - YYYY
GENDER - M|F
Votesmart - id
COMMENT

==rosetta.tsv==
This is currently defined to be a two=column table that maps AUTHORITY:id to the SRC GLOBALID as follows:

* AUTHORITY is a code for the authority, and "id" is the id of the person according to that authority
* GLOBALID is the SRC globalid

Both fields are required.

The authority prefix "SRC" is reserved for the SRC project so that SRC localids can be mapped to SRC globalids.
