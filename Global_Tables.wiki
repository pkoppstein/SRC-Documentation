==members.tsv==

members.tsv is a global table for individuals.  Distinct individuals should have distinct SRC global ids, but for the sake of integrity, both GLOBALID and SURNAME are required.
In addition, each entry should have at least one of: FIRSTNAME or VOTESSMART_ID.

The mapping from other ids to GLOBALID is achieved via the so-called "Rosetta Stone" table, rosetta.tsv.

The fields of members.tsv are as follows:

* * GLOBALID - the SRC global id for this person; normally, this is of the form STccyyClid where:
** ST is a two-letter state code
** ccyy is a four-digit year
** C is either U or L (for upper or lower chamber)
** lid is the three-digit SRC localid for this person in ST/st_yy/reg
* * SURNAME - normally as listed in the vote record
* + FIRSTNAME - first name or at least first initial; at least one of BIRTHYEAR or full FIRSTNAME should be given
* MIDDLENAMES - preferably all middle names, or at least initials
* ALTERNATIVESURNAMES - multiple alternatives should be separated by | (e.g. "Smith|Jones")
* SUFFIX - the suffix or suffixes, for example: Jr. III
* NICKNAME - usually a single name, without parentheses or quotation marks, for example: Jim
* BIRTHYEAR - YYYY
* GENDER - M|F
* + VOTESMART_ID - the votesmart id of this individual 
* COMMENT

As indicated above, the SRC globalid of an individual has the form STccyyClid and should correspond to an individual with the SRC localid "lid" in the corresponding directory ST/st_yy/reg.  Obviously, not every such localid gives rise to a valid SRC globalid.

==rosetta.tsv==
This is currently defined to be a two-column table that maps AUTHORITY:id to the SRC GLOBALID as follows:

* * AUTHORITY is a code for the authority, and "id" is an id of the person according to that authority
* * GLOBALID is the SRC globalid

Both fields are required.

The authority prefix "SRC" is a special case.  It can be used to map pseudo-SRC ids to actual SRC ids.  For example, if a legislator with SRC globalid NY1999L123 also appears with localid 234 in NY/ny_a00/reg, then the following would be an appropriate entry in rosetta.tsv (using "," to indicate the field delimiter):

{{{SRC:NY2000L234,NY1999L123}}}

Other "well-known" prefixes are:

* OS - OpenStates
* VS - Votesmart
* CSMSP
