=== Wiki features ===

This wiki uses the [[http://www.wikicreole.org/|Creole]] syntax, and is fully compatible with the 1.0 specification.

The wiki itself is actually a mercurial repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to us. It will be live immediately.

To clone the wiki repository:

{{{
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/states50/nominate/wiki
}}}

Wiki pages are normal files, with the .wiki extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.

=== Syntax highlighting ===

You can also highlight snippets of text, we use the excellent [[http://www.pygments.org/|Pygments]] library.

See also [[http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/|the vast library of Pygment lexers]]. The 'short name' or the 'mimetype' of anything in there can be used here.
