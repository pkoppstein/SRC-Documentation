==Scripts==
There are various scripts for processing editing directives.  Earlier versions did not support nol_number in Corrections.csv. Some later versions may not require this field.

Here we focus on two scripts that are part of this repository:
* edit.NOMINATE.rb for processing directives in the Corrections.csv format
* updateLocalid.NOMINATE.rb for processing directives in the nol_number_corrections.csv format

These two scripts support special editing directives, e.g. for deletion, adding an alias, declaring a specific name to be the canonical name, and so on.

The scripts are self-documenting via the --help option. 
== nol_number_corrections ==

Here is a quick summary of the different directives that are supported, focusing on the three main fields of the "nol_number_corrections" format, i.e.
"Original_nol_name,nol_number,steve_number".

In the following, a **distinguished name** is a name for which there is a unique LOCALID (ignoring "000 000" entries) at the time the directive is processed.

* Standard - specify all three fields explicitly (using a null string if nol_number is empty)
** e.g. {{{SPEAKER,,023}}}
* Split almost all CamelCase names
** e.g. {{{^,,^}}}
* Guided split (see below)
** e.g. {{{"UnusualSplit, Abc",,"Unusual^Split, A."}}}
* Deletion
** e.g. {{{RESENT: 000,021,DELETE}}}
* Alias creation for an existing **distinguished name**: ALIAS~,~,DISTINGUISHED_NAME
** e.g. {{{Smith J,,"Smith, John A."}}}

The idea with "guided splits" is that on the RHS, each of the parts should already be defined. In the example, "Unusual" and "Split, A." should already have entries in pty_nol.txt (or at least in the in-memory version when the directive is being processed).
