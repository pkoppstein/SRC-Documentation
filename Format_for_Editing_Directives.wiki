==Scripts==
There are various scripts for processing editing directives.  Earlier versions did not support nol_number in Corrections.csv. Some later versions may not require this field.

Here we focus on two scripts that are part of this repository:
* edit.NOMINATE.rb for processing directives in the Corrections.csv format
* updateLocalid.NOMINATE.rb for processing directives in the nol_number_corrections.csv format

These two scripts support special editing directives, e.g. for deletion, adding an alias, declaring a specific name to be the canonical name, and so on.

The scripts are self-documenting via the --help option.
