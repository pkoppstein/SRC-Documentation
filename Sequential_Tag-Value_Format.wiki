==Sequential Tag-Value Format ==

This format is intended for capturing certain data that might appear in
the proceedings of a legislative body.

1. The order of lines in the file is important.

2. Each line takes the form:

Tag: value

3. If "Tag" is blank, it is understood to be "Member", where "Member" is the identifier as it appears in that particular rollcall (e.g. "Smith"), or as a disambiguation of that identifier used in a different rollcall (e.g. "Smith (43)").

4. For certain tags, the value must be blank.

5. The set of tags is predefined.  

6. Unless otherwise specified, the field names defined for the three standard .tsv files (see [[Schema%20for%20Additional%20Data|Schema for Additional Data]]) can be used.

# This example is intended to be illustrative rather than precise.
